# After a number of years in sales I've decided to pivot into the operations function. I've seen sclerotic operations departments that are siloed away, seldom interact with the wider sales org and take months or years to investigate, analyse, experiment with and implement processes. These experiences as well as a general enjoyment for problem solving, cross-functional collaboration, and presenting have spurred me to do my level best to be in the "room where it happens".

# Check out my progress, I can assure you this is only the beginning and this repository is just getting started.

# Upon reflecting on the state of this repo, I can see it's probably about time to start organising the files into separate branches - work in progress
